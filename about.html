        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Caring About COVID-19 is a narrative digital project created by Michelle Bobilev, a Digital Humanities and Social Sciences student at the Rochester Institute of Technology as a final project for a DHSS Media Narrative course. This project focuses on the experience and response of various communities and individuals to the coronavirus. The element of time is considered into the project by following the coronavirus from its earliest points to the present through the World Health Organization’s (WHO) response to COVID-19 <span><a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/29-06-2020-covidtimeline">timeline</a></span>.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In addition to using events from the WHO timeline as markers of significant points in the progression of the virus, the Caring About COVID-19 timeline incorporates the experiences of students, patients treated for the virus, homeless individuals, racial and ethnic disparities, the elderly and small business owners in between the WHO markers. Each experience is represented by the smaller circles on the timeline, the colors of which correspond to the aforementioned categories. The experiences are purposefully chronologically placed by publishing date or the approximate date the focus individual suffered from COVID-19. Users interacting with the Caring About COVID-19 timeline will be able to notice the number and variety of experiences increase as the timeline approaches the present. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">COVID-19 impacted our global community in devastating, life-altering ways. The world is waiting for a vaccine in hopes of reverting to the norm, a “norm” turned upside-down for those grieving for one of the 1.52 million deaths to date. The pandemic is continuing to spiral out of control in a globally ill-prepared environment, a challenge that can only be overcome through collective, proactive efforts to minimize and prevent the spread. The incentive behind Caring About COVID-19 is the belief that individuals who fail to comply with expected safety behaviors do so due to their ignorance, which is proving to be increasingly detrimental. As we adapt to living with the virus it is easier to get more comfortable and less careful, to the point of apathy for some. The goal of the Caring About COVID-19 is that, through exploring the eye-opening, realistic COVID-19 experiences of others, those same individuals will realize the importance of doing their part in the containment and prevention of the virus. The Caring About COVID-19 timeline brings the user’s attention to individual voices whose experiences and stories throughout the pandemic will aim to shape the user’s lens into deeper understanding about the importance of the safety precautions and behaviors that must be exercised to decrease and potentially eliminate the threat of the virus.</p>
